You can enable tagging on any given model simply by adding the `Taggable` 
behavior using the `actAs` functionality in your models.

Below is an example where we enable it on a simple `BlogPost` model.

    [yml]
    BlogPost:
      actAs: [Taggable]
      columns:
        title:
          type: string(255)
          notnull: true
        description:
          type: string(255)
          notnull: true

Now when we build our models we will instantly have some new functionality 
available that we can utilize to set the tags a record has by simply specifying 
a comma separated list of tags.

Enabling this behavior will create a model named `BlogPostTaggableTag` and use it as a `refClass` to create a many to many relationship between `BlogPost` and `TaggableTag`.

> **NOTE**
> The `TaggableTag` model is auto generated for you internally by Doctrine and it is a simple model with is an `id` and a `name`.
