The `EventLoggable` is a simple behavior to log events on your models and connections. It can be enabled like the following.

    [yml]
    User:
      actAs:
        EventLoggable:
          events: [preDelete, preQuery]
          logger:
            type: file
            path: /path/to/logfile.log
      columns:
        username: string(255)
        password: string(255)

Now when you execute some code it will log the events which you have specified.

    Array
    (
        [method] => preDelete
        [name] => delete record
        [code] => 21
        [skipped] => 
        [time] => 
        [query] => 
        [params] => Array
            (
            )

        [invoker] => Array
            (
                [id] => 1
                [name] => ok
            )

    )
    
If you don't specify any array of events then all events will be logged.
