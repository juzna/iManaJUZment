System for ISPs

Used 3rd party libraries:
 - Doctrine 2 from git, with some little patches
 - Nette - from archive, 2.0alpha (should find, how to convert Nette from Git to php5.3 version and replace)
 - Dibi - from git (maybe wont be needed)


Instalation:
  # clone git repository
  git clone git://github.com/juzna/iManaJUZment.git isp
  cd isp

  # download submodules
  git submodules init
  git submodules update

  # set-up development mode
  touch app/development

  # prepare temp/ and log/ dir
  mkdir -m 0777 temp log

  # update .htaccess file to your needs (rewrite config may need changes)
  nano document_root/.htaccess

  # set-up apache's virtualhost to document_root/ directory

  # prepare mysql database and execute initial SQL script

  # set database connection details in app/config.ini

  # voila, you should be running
